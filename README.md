# Safe Campus by Kelate4lyfe

Safe Campus is a mobile and web-based application developed as part of the ICT602 Mobile Technology group project. The system integrates an Android mobile application with a web-based administrative platform to support real-time, location-based reporting and management.

The application leverages GPS technology, interactive maps, and a centralized server to enable users to submit incident reports while allowing administrators to monitor and manage reported data efficiently.
